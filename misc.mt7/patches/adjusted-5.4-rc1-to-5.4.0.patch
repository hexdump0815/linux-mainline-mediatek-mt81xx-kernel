+iTLB multihit
+=============
+
+iTLB multihit is an erratum where some processors may incur a machine check
+error, possibly resulting in an unrecoverable CPU lockup, when an
+instruction fetch hits multiple entries in the instruction TLB. This can
+occur when the page size is changed along with either the physical address
+or cache type. A malicious guest running on a virtualized system can
+exploit this erratum to perform a denial of service attack.
+
+
+Affected processors
+-------------------
+
+Variations of this erratum are present on most Intel Core and Xeon processor
+models. The erratum is not present on:
+
+   - non-Intel processors
+
+   - Some Atoms (Airmont, Bonnell, Goldmont, GoldmontPlus, Saltwell, Silvermont)
+
+   - Intel processors that have the PSCHANGE_MC_NO bit set in the
+     IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR.
+
+
+Related CVEs
+------------
+
+The following CVE entry is related to this issue:
+
+   ==============  =================================================
+   CVE-2018-12207  Machine Check Error Avoidance on Page Size Change
+   ==============  =================================================
+
+
+Problem
+-------
+
+Privileged software, including OS and virtual machine managers (VMM), are in
+charge of memory management. A key component in memory management is the control
+of the page tables. Modern processors use virtual memory, a technique that creates
+the illusion of a very large memory for processors. This virtual space is split
+into pages of a given size. Page tables translate virtual addresses to physical
+addresses.
+
+To reduce latency when performing a virtual to physical address translation,
+processors include a structure, called TLB, that caches recent translations.
+There are separate TLBs for instruction (iTLB) and data (dTLB).
+
+Under this errata, instructions are fetched from a linear address translated
+using a 4 KB translation cached in the iTLB. Privileged software modifies the
+paging structure so that the same linear address using large page size (2 MB, 4
+MB, 1 GB) with a different physical address or memory type.  After the page
+structure modification but before the software invalidates any iTLB entries for
+the linear address, a code fetch that happens on the same linear address may
+cause a machine-check error which can result in a system hang or shutdown.
+
+
+Attack scenarios
+----------------
+
+Attacks against the iTLB multihit erratum can be mounted from malicious
+guests in a virtualized system.
+
+
+iTLB multihit system information
+--------------------------------
+
+The Linux kernel provides a sysfs interface to enumerate the current iTLB
+multihit status of the system:whether the system is vulnerable and which
+mitigations are active. The relevant sysfs file is:
+
+/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
+
+The possible values in this file are:
+
+.. list-table::
+
+     * - Not affected
+       - The processor is not vulnerable.
+     * - KVM: Mitigation: Split huge pages
+       - Software changes mitigate this issue.
+     * - KVM: Vulnerable
+       - The processor is vulnerable, but no mitigation enabled
+
+
+Enumeration of the erratum
+--------------------------------
+
+A new bit has been allocated in the IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES (PSCHANGE_MC_NO) msr
+and will be set on CPU's which are mitigated against this issue.
+
+   =======================================   ===========   ===============================
+   IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR                Not present   Possibly vulnerable,check model
+   IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES[PSCHANGE_MC_NO]    '0'           Likely vulnerable,check model
+   IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES[PSCHANGE_MC_NO]    '1'           Not vulnerable
+   =======================================   ===========   ===============================
+
+
+Mitigation mechanism
+-------------------------
+
+This erratum can be mitigated by restricting the use of large page sizes to
+non-executable pages.  This forces all iTLB entries to be 4K, and removes
+the possibility of multiple hits.
+
+In order to mitigate the vulnerability, KVM initially marks all huge pages
+as non-executable. If the guest attempts to execute in one of those pages,
+the page is broken down into 4K pages, which are then marked executable.
+
+If EPT is disabled or not available on the host, KVM is in control of TLB
+flushes and the problematic situation cannot happen.  However, the shadow
+EPT paging mechanism used by nested virtualization is vulnerable, because
+the nested guest can trigger multiple iTLB hits by modifying its own
+(non-nested) page tables.  For simplicity, KVM will make large pages
+non-executable in all shadow paging modes.
+
+Mitigation control on the kernel command line and KVM - module parameter
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The KVM hypervisor mitigation mechanism for marking huge pages as
+non-executable can be controlled with a module parameter "nx_huge_pages=".
+The kernel command line allows to control the iTLB multihit mitigations at
+boot time with the option "kvm.nx_huge_pages=".
+
+The valid arguments for these options are:
+
+  ==========  ================================================================
+  force       Mitigation is enabled. In this case, the mitigation implements
+              non-executable huge pages in Linux kernel KVM module. All huge
+              pages in the EPT are marked as non-executable.
+              If a guest attempts to execute in one of those pages, the page is
+              broken down into 4K pages, which are then marked executable.

+
+Mitigation selection guide
+--------------------------
+
+1. No virtualization in use
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   The system is protected by the kernel unconditionally and no further

+
+2. Virtualization with trusted guests
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+   If the guest comes from a trusted source, you may assume that the guest will
+   not attempt to maliciously exploit these errata and no further action is
+   required.
+
+3. Virtualization with untrusted guests
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+   If the guest comes from an untrusted source, the guest host kernel will need
+   to apply iTLB multihit mitigation via the kernel command line or kvm
+   module parameter.

+TAA - TSX Asynchronous Abort
+======================================
+
+TAA is a hardware vulnerability that allows unprivileged speculative access to
+data which is available in various CPU internal buffers by using asynchronous
+aborts within an Intel TSX transactional region.
+
+Affected processors
+-------------------
+
+This vulnerability only affects Intel processors that support Intel
+Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) when the TAA_NO bit (bit 8)
+is 0 in the IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR.  On processors where the MDS_NO bit
+(bit 5) is 0 in the IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR, the existing MDS mitigations
+also mitigate against TAA.
+
+Whether a processor is affected or not can be read out from the TAA
+vulnerability file in sysfs. See :ref:`tsx_async_abort_sys_info`.
+
+Related CVEs
+------------
+
+The following CVE entry is related to this TAA issue:
+
+   ==============  =====  ===================================================
+   CVE-2019-11135  TAA    TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) condition on some
+                          microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may
+                          allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
+                          information disclosure via a side channel with
+                          local access.
+   ==============  =====  ===================================================
+
+Problem
+-------
+
+When performing store, load or L1 refill operations, processors write
+data into temporary microarchitectural structures (buffers). The data in
+those buffers can be forwarded to load operations as an optimization.
+
+Intel TSX is an extension to the x86 instruction set architecture that adds
+hardware transactional memory support to improve performance of multi-threaded
+software. TSX lets the processor expose and exploit concurrency hidden in an
+application due to dynamically avoiding unnecessary synchronization.
+
+TSX supports atomic memory transactions that are either committed (success) or
+aborted. During an abort, operations that happened within the transactional region
+are rolled back. An asynchronous abort takes place, among other options, when a
+different thread accesses a cache line that is also used within the transactional
+region when that access might lead to a data race.
+
+Immediately after an uncompleted asynchronous abort, certain speculatively
+executed loads may read data from those internal buffers and pass it to dependent
+operations. This can be then used to infer the value via a cache side channel
+attack.
+
+Because the buffers are potentially shared between Hyper-Threads cross
+Hyper-Thread attacks are possible.
+
+The victim of a malicious actor does not need to make use of TSX. Only the
+attacker needs to begin a TSX transaction and raise an asynchronous abort
+which in turn potenitally leaks data stored in the buffers.
+
+More detailed technical information is available in the TAA specific x86
+architecture section: :ref:`Documentation/x86/tsx_async_abort.rst <tsx_async_abort>`.
+
+
+Attack scenarios
+----------------
+
+Attacks against the TAA vulnerability can be implemented from unprivileged
+applications running on hosts or guests.
+
+As for MDS, the attacker has no control over the memory addresses that can
+be leaked. Only the victim is responsible for bringing data to the CPU. As
+a result, the malicious actor has to sample as much data as possible and
+then postprocess it to try to infer any useful information from it.
+
+A potential attacker only has read access to the data. Also, there is no direct
+privilege escalation by using this technique.
+
+
+.. _tsx_async_abort_sys_info:
+
+TAA system information
+-----------------------
+
+The Linux kernel provides a sysfs interface to enumerate the current TAA status
+of mitigated systems. The relevant sysfs file is:
+
+/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
+
+The possible values in this file are:
+
+.. list-table::
+
+   * - 'Vulnerable'
+     - The CPU is affected by this vulnerability and the microcode and kernel mitigation are not applied.
+   * - 'Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode'
+     - The system tries to clear the buffers but the microcode might not support the operation.
+   * - 'Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers'
+     - The microcode has been updated to clear the buffers. TSX is still enabled.
+   * - 'Mitigation: TSX disabled'
+     - TSX is disabled.
+   * - 'Not affected'
+     - The CPU is not affected by this issue.
+
+.. _ucode_needed:
+
+Best effort mitigation mode
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+If the processor is vulnerable, but the availability of the microcode-based
+mitigation mechanism is not advertised via CPUID the kernel selects a best
+effort mitigation mode.  This mode invokes the mitigation instructions
+without a guarantee that they clear the CPU buffers.
+
+This is done to address virtualization scenarios where the host has the
+microcode update applied, but the hypervisor is not yet updated to expose the
+CPUID to the guest. If the host has updated microcode the protection takes
+effect; otherwise a few CPU cycles are wasted pointlessly.
+
+The state in the tsx_async_abort sysfs file reflects this situation
+accordingly.
+
+
+Mitigation mechanism
+--------------------
+
+The kernel detects the affected CPUs and the presence of the microcode which is
+required. If a CPU is affected and the microcode is available, then the kernel
+enables the mitigation by default.
+
+
+The mitigation can be controlled at boot time via a kernel command line option.
+See :ref:`taa_mitigation_control_command_line`.
+
+.. _virt_mechanism:
+
+Virtualization mitigation
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+Affected systems where the host has TAA microcode and TAA is mitigated by
+having disabled TSX previously, are not vulnerable regardless of the status
+of the VMs.
+
+In all other cases, if the host either does not have the TAA microcode or
+the kernel is not mitigated, the system might be vulnerable.
+
+
+.. _taa_mitigation_control_command_line:
+
+Mitigation control on the kernel command line
+---------------------------------------------
+
+The kernel command line allows to control the TAA mitigations at boot time with
+the option "tsx_async_abort=". The valid arguments for this option are:
+
+  ============  =============================================================
+  off		This option disables the TAA mitigation on affected platforms.
+                If the system has TSX enabled (see next parameter) and the CPU
+                is affected, the system is vulnerable.
+
+  full	        TAA mitigation is enabled. If TSX is enabled, on an affected
+                system it will clear CPU buffers on ring transitions. On
+                systems which are MDS-affected and deploy MDS mitigation,
+                TAA is also mitigated. Specifying this option on those
+                systems will have no effect.
+
+  full,nosmt    The same as tsx_async_abort=full, with SMT disabled on
+                vulnerable CPUs that have TSX enabled. This is the complete
+                mitigation. When TSX is disabled, SMT is not disabled because
+                CPU is not vulnerable to cross-thread TAA attacks.
+  ============  =============================================================
+
+Not specifying this option is equivalent to "tsx_async_abort=full".
+
+The kernel command line also allows to control the TSX feature using the
+parameter "tsx=" on CPUs which support TSX control. MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL is used
+to control the TSX feature and the enumeration of the TSX feature bits (RTM
+and HLE) in CPUID.
+
+The valid options are:
+
+  ============  =============================================================
+  off		Disables TSX on the system.
+
+                Note that this option takes effect only on newer CPUs which are
+                not vulnerable to MDS, i.e., have MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.MDS_NO=1
+                and which get the new IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR through a microcode
+                update. This new MSR allows for the reliable deactivation of
+                the TSX functionality.
+
+  on		Enables TSX.
+
+                Although there are mitigations for all known security
+                vulnerabilities, TSX has been known to be an accelerator for
+                several previous speculation-related CVEs, and so there may be
+                unknown security risks associated with leaving it enabled.
+
+  auto		Disables TSX if X86_BUG_TAA is present, otherwise enables TSX
+                on the system.
+  ============  =============================================================
+
+Not specifying this option is equivalent to "tsx=off".
+
+The following combinations of the "tsx_async_abort" and "tsx" are possible. For
+affected platforms tsx=auto is equivalent to tsx=off and the result will be:
+
+  =========  ==========================   =========================================
+  tsx=on     tsx_async_abort=full         The system will use VERW to clear CPU
+                                          buffers. Cross-thread attacks are still
+					  possible on SMT machines.
+  tsx=on     tsx_async_abort=full,nosmt   As above, cross-thread attacks on SMT
+                                          mitigated.
+  tsx=on     tsx_async_abort=off          The system is vulnerable.
+  tsx=off    tsx_async_abort=full         TSX might be disabled if microcode
+                                          provides a TSX control MSR. If so,

+Symbol Namespaces
+=================
+
+The following document describes how to use Symbol Namespaces to structure the
+export surface of in-kernel symbols exported through the family of
+EXPORT_SYMBOL() macros.
+
+.. Table of Contents
+
+	=== 1 Introduction
+	=== 2 How to define Symbol Namespaces
+	   --- 2.1 Using the EXPORT_SYMBOL macros
+	   --- 2.2 Using the DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE define
+	=== 3 How to use Symbols exported in Namespaces
+	=== 4 Loading Modules that use namespaced Symbols
+	=== 5 Automatically creating MODULE_IMPORT_NS statements
+
+1. Introduction
+===============
+
+Symbol Namespaces have been introduced as a means to structure the export
+surface of the in-kernel API. It allows subsystem maintainers to partition
+their exported symbols into separate namespaces. That is useful for
+documentation purposes (think of the SUBSYSTEM_DEBUG namespace) as well as for
+limiting the availability of a set of symbols for use in other parts of the
+kernel. As of today, modules that make use of symbols exported into namespaces,
+are required to import the namespace. Otherwise the kernel will, depending on
+its configuration, reject loading the module or warn about a missing import.
+
+2. How to define Symbol Namespaces
+==================================
+
+Symbols can be exported into namespace using different methods. All of them are
+changing the way EXPORT_SYMBOL and friends are instrumented to create ksymtab
+entries.
+
+2.1 Using the EXPORT_SYMBOL macros
+==================================
+
+In addition to the macros EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), that allow
+exporting of kernel symbols to the kernel symbol table, variants of these are
+available to export symbols into a certain namespace: EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS() and
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS_GPL(). They take one additional argument: the namespace.
+Please note that due to macro expansion that argument needs to be a
+preprocessor symbol. E.g. to export the symbol `usb_stor_suspend` into the
+namespace `USB_STORAGE`, use::
+
+	EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS(usb_stor_suspend, USB_STORAGE);
+
+The corresponding ksymtab entry struct `kernel_symbol` will have the member
+`namespace` set accordingly. A symbol that is exported without a namespace will
+refer to `NULL`. There is no default namespace if none is defined. `modpost`
+and kernel/module.c make use the namespace at build time or module load time,
+respectively.
+
+2.2 Using the DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE define
+=============================================
+
+Defining namespaces for all symbols of a subsystem can be very verbose and may
+become hard to maintain. Therefore a default define (DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE)
+is been provided, that, if set, will become the default for all EXPORT_SYMBOL()
+and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() macro expansions that do not specify a namespace.
+
+There are multiple ways of specifying this define and it depends on the
+subsystem and the maintainer's preference, which one to use. The first option
+is to define the default namespace in the `Makefile` of the subsystem. E.g. to
+export all symbols defined in usb-common into the namespace USB_COMMON, add a
+line like this to drivers/usb/common/Makefile::
+
+	ccflags-y += -DDEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE=USB_COMMON
+
+That will affect all EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() statements. A
+symbol exported with EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS() while this definition is present, will
+still be exported into the namespace that is passed as the namespace argument
+as this argument has preference over a default symbol namespace.
+
+A second option to define the default namespace is directly in the compilation
+unit as preprocessor statement. The above example would then read::
+
+	#undef  DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE
+	#define DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE USB_COMMON
+
+within the corresponding compilation unit before any EXPORT_SYMBOL macro is
+used.
+
+3. How to use Symbols exported in Namespaces
+============================================
+
+In order to use symbols that are exported into namespaces, kernel modules need
+to explicitly import these namespaces. Otherwise the kernel might reject to
+load the module. The module code is required to use the macro MODULE_IMPORT_NS
+for the namespaces it uses symbols from. E.g. a module using the
+usb_stor_suspend symbol from above, needs to import the namespace USB_STORAGE
+using a statement like::
+
+	MODULE_IMPORT_NS(USB_STORAGE);
+
+This will create a `modinfo` tag in the module for each imported namespace.
+This has the side effect, that the imported namespaces of a module can be
+inspected with modinfo::
+
+	$ modinfo drivers/usb/storage/ums-karma.ko
+	[...]
+	import_ns:      USB_STORAGE
+	[...]
+
+
+It is advisable to add the MODULE_IMPORT_NS() statement close to other module
+metadata definitions like MODULE_AUTHOR() or MODULE_LICENSE(). Refer to section
+5. for a way to create missing import statements automatically.
+
+4. Loading Modules that use namespaced Symbols
+==============================================
+
+At module loading time (e.g. `insmod`), the kernel will check each symbol
+referenced from the module for its availability and whether the namespace it
+might be exported to has been imported by the module. The default behaviour of
+the kernel is to reject loading modules that don't specify sufficient imports.
+An error will be logged and loading will be failed with EINVAL. In order to
+allow loading of modules that don't satisfy this precondition, a configuration
+option is available: Setting MODULE_ALLOW_MISSING_NAMESPACE_IMPORTS=y will
+enable loading regardless, but will emit a warning.
+
+5. Automatically creating MODULE_IMPORT_NS statements
+=====================================================
+
+Missing namespaces imports can easily be detected at build time. In fact,
+modpost will emit a warning if a module uses a symbol from a namespace
+without importing it.
+MODULE_IMPORT_NS() statements will usually be added at a definite location
+(along with other module meta data). To make the life of module authors (and
+subsystem maintainers) easier, a script and make target is available to fixup
+missing imports. Fixing missing imports can be done with::
+
+	$ make nsdeps
+
+A typical scenario for module authors would be::
+
+	- write code that depends on a symbol from a not imported namespace
+	- `make`
+	- notice the warning of modpost telling about a missing import
+	- run `make nsdeps` to add the import to the correct code location
+
+For subsystem maintainers introducing a namespace, the steps are very similar.
+Again, `make nsdeps` will eventually add the missing namespace imports for
+in-tree modules::
+
+	- move or add symbols to a namespace (e.g. with EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS())
+	- `make` (preferably with an allmodconfig to cover all in-kernel
+	  modules)
+	- notice the warning of modpost telling about a missing import
+	- run `make nsdeps` to add the import to the correct code location
+

-Symbol Namespaces
-=================
-
-The following document describes how to use Symbol Namespaces to structure the
-export surface of in-kernel symbols exported through the family of
-EXPORT_SYMBOL() macros.
-
-.. Table of Contents
-
-	=== 1 Introduction
-	=== 2 How to define Symbol Namespaces
-	   --- 2.1 Using the EXPORT_SYMBOL macros
-	   --- 2.2 Using the DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE define
-	=== 3 How to use Symbols exported in Namespaces
-	=== 4 Loading Modules that use namespaced Symbols
-	=== 5 Automatically creating MODULE_IMPORT_NS statements
-
-1. Introduction
-===============
-
-Symbol Namespaces have been introduced as a means to structure the export
-surface of the in-kernel API. It allows subsystem maintainers to partition
-their exported symbols into separate namespaces. That is useful for
-documentation purposes (think of the SUBSYSTEM_DEBUG namespace) as well as for
-limiting the availability of a set of symbols for use in other parts of the
-kernel. As of today, modules that make use of symbols exported into namespaces,
-are required to import the namespace. Otherwise the kernel will, depending on
-its configuration, reject loading the module or warn about a missing import.
-
-2. How to define Symbol Namespaces
-==================================
-
-Symbols can be exported into namespace using different methods. All of them are
-changing the way EXPORT_SYMBOL and friends are instrumented to create ksymtab
-entries.
-
-2.1 Using the EXPORT_SYMBOL macros
-==================================
-
-In addition to the macros EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), that allow
-exporting of kernel symbols to the kernel symbol table, variants of these are
-available to export symbols into a certain namespace: EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS() and
-EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS_GPL(). They take one additional argument: the namespace.
-Please note that due to macro expansion that argument needs to be a
-preprocessor symbol. E.g. to export the symbol `usb_stor_suspend` into the
-namespace `USB_STORAGE`, use::
-
-	EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS(usb_stor_suspend, USB_STORAGE);
-
-The corresponding ksymtab entry struct `kernel_symbol` will have the member
-`namespace` set accordingly. A symbol that is exported without a namespace will
-refer to `NULL`. There is no default namespace if none is defined. `modpost`
-and kernel/module.c make use the namespace at build time or module load time,
-respectively.
-
-2.2 Using the DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE define
-=============================================
-
-Defining namespaces for all symbols of a subsystem can be very verbose and may
-become hard to maintain. Therefore a default define (DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE)
-is been provided, that, if set, will become the default for all EXPORT_SYMBOL()
-and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() macro expansions that do not specify a namespace.
-
-There are multiple ways of specifying this define and it depends on the
-subsystem and the maintainer's preference, which one to use. The first option
-is to define the default namespace in the `Makefile` of the subsystem. E.g. to
-export all symbols defined in usb-common into the namespace USB_COMMON, add a
-line like this to drivers/usb/common/Makefile::
-
-	ccflags-y += -DDEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE=USB_COMMON
-
-That will affect all EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() statements. A
-symbol exported with EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS() while this definition is present, will
-still be exported into the namespace that is passed as the namespace argument
-as this argument has preference over a default symbol namespace.
-
-A second option to define the default namespace is directly in the compilation
-unit as preprocessor statement. The above example would then read::
-
-	#undef  DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE
-	#define DEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE USB_COMMON
-
-within the corresponding compilation unit before any EXPORT_SYMBOL macro is
-used.
-
-3. How to use Symbols exported in Namespaces
-============================================
-
-In order to use symbols that are exported into namespaces, kernel modules need
-to explicitly import these namespaces. Otherwise the kernel might reject to
-load the module. The module code is required to use the macro MODULE_IMPORT_NS
-for the namespaces it uses symbols from. E.g. a module using the
-usb_stor_suspend symbol from above, needs to import the namespace USB_STORAGE
-using a statement like::
-
-	MODULE_IMPORT_NS(USB_STORAGE);
-
-This will create a `modinfo` tag in the module for each imported namespace.
-This has the side effect, that the imported namespaces of a module can be
-inspected with modinfo::
-
-	$ modinfo drivers/usb/storage/ums-karma.ko
-	[...]
-	import_ns:      USB_STORAGE
-	[...]
-
-
-It is advisable to add the MODULE_IMPORT_NS() statement close to other module
-metadata definitions like MODULE_AUTHOR() or MODULE_LICENSE(). Refer to section
-5. for a way to create missing import statements automatically.
-
-4. Loading Modules that use namespaced Symbols
-==============================================
-
-At module loading time (e.g. `insmod`), the kernel will check each symbol
-referenced from the module for its availability and whether the namespace it
-might be exported to has been imported by the module. The default behaviour of
-the kernel is to reject loading modules that don't specify sufficient imports.
-An error will be logged and loading will be failed with EINVAL. In order to
-allow loading of modules that don't satisfy this precondition, a configuration
-option is available: Setting MODULE_ALLOW_MISSING_NAMESPACE_IMPORTS=y will
-enable loading regardless, but will emit a warning.
-
-5. Automatically creating MODULE_IMPORT_NS statements
-=====================================================
-
-Missing namespaces imports can easily be detected at build time. In fact,
-modpost will emit a warning if a module uses a symbol from a namespace
-without importing it.
-MODULE_IMPORT_NS() statements will usually be added at a definite location
-(along with other module meta data). To make the life of module authors (and
-subsystem maintainers) easier, a script and make target is available to fixup
-missing imports. Fixing missing imports can be done with::
-
-	$ make nsdeps
-
-A typical scenario for module authors would be::
-
-	- write code that depends on a symbol from a not imported namespace
-	- `make`
-	- notice the warning of modpost telling about a missing import
-	- run `make nsdeps` to add the import to the correct code location
-
-For subsystem maintainers introducing a namespace, the steps are very similar.
-Again, `make nsdeps` will eventually add the missing namespace imports for
-in-tree modules::
-
-	- move or add symbols to a namespace (e.g. with EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS())
-	- `make` (preferably with an allmodconfig to cover all in-kernel
-	  modules)
-	- notice the warning of modpost telling about a missing import
-	- run `make nsdeps` to add the import to the correct code location
-

-- Initial Revision
-
-
-Overview
-========
-
-This README will address issues regarding how to configure the kernel
-to access a RIO 500 mp3 player.
-Before I explain how to use this to access the Rio500 please be warned:
-
-.. warning::
-
-   Please note that this software is still under development.  The authors
-   are in no way responsible for any damage that may occur, no matter how
-   inconsequential.
-
-It seems that the Rio has a problem when sending .mp3 with low batteries.
-I suggest when the batteries are low and you want to transfer stuff that you
-replace it with a fresh one. In my case, what happened is I lost two 16kb
-blocks (they are no longer usable to store information to it). But I don't
-know if that's normal or not; it could simply be a problem with the flash
-memory.
-
-In an extreme case, I left my Rio playing overnight and the batteries wore
-down to nothing and appear to have corrupted the flash memory. My RIO
-needed to be replaced as a result.  Diamond tech support is aware of the
-problem.  Do NOT allow your batteries to wear down to nothing before
-changing them.  It appears RIO 500 firmware does not handle low battery
-power well at all.
-
-On systems with OHCI controllers, the kernel OHCI code appears to have
-power on problems with some chipsets.  If you are having problems
-connecting to your RIO 500, try turning it on first and then plugging it
-into the USB cable.

-Authors
--------
-
-Most of the code was written by Cesar Miquel <miquel@df.uba.ar>. Keith
-Clayton <kclayton@jps.net> is incharge of the PPC port and making sure
-things work there. Bruce Tenison <btenison@dibbs.net> is adding support
-for .fon files and also does testing. The program will mostly sure be
-re-written and Pete Ikusz along with the rest will re-design it. I would
-also like to thank Tri Nguyen <tmn_3022000@hotmail.com> who provided use
-with some important information regarding the communication with the Rio.
-
-Additional Information and userspace tools
-
-	http://rio500.sourceforge.net/
-
-
-Requirements
-============
-
-A host with a USB port running a Linux kernel with RIO 500 support enabled.
-
-The driver is a module called rio500, which should be automatically loaded
-as you plug in your device. If that fails you can manually load it with
-
-  modprobe rio500
-
-Udev should automatically create a device node as soon as plug in your device.
-If that fails, you can manually add a device for the USB rio500::
-
-  mknod /dev/usb/rio500 c 180 64
-
-In that case, set appropriate permissions for /dev/usb/rio500 (don't forget
-about group and world permissions).  Both read and write permissions are
-required for proper operation.
-
-That's it.  The Rio500 Utils at: http://rio500.sourceforge.net should
-be able to access the rio500.
-
-Limits
-======
-
-You can use only a single rio500 device at a time with your computer.
-
-Bugs
-====
-
-If you encounter any problems feel free to drop me an email.

+TSX Async Abort (TAA) mitigation
+================================
+
+.. _tsx_async_abort:
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+TSX Async Abort (TAA) is a side channel attack on internal buffers in some
+Intel processors similar to Microachitectural Data Sampling (MDS).  In this
+case certain loads may speculatively pass invalid data to dependent operations
+when an asynchronous abort condition is pending in a Transactional
+Synchronization Extensions (TSX) transaction.  This includes loads with no
+fault or assist condition. Such loads may speculatively expose stale data from
+the same uarch data structures as in MDS, with same scope of exposure i.e.
+same-thread and cross-thread. This issue affects all current processors that
+support TSX.
+
+Mitigation strategy
+-------------------
+
+a) TSX disable - one of the mitigations is to disable TSX. A new MSR
+IA32_TSX_CTRL will be available in future and current processors after
+microcode update which can be used to disable TSX. In addition, it
+controls the enumeration of the TSX feature bits (RTM and HLE) in CPUID.
+
+b) Clear CPU buffers - similar to MDS, clearing the CPU buffers mitigates this
+vulnerability. More details on this approach can be found in
+:ref:`Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.rst <mds>`.
+
+Kernel internal mitigation modes
+--------------------------------
+
+ =============    ============================================================
+ off              Mitigation is disabled. Either the CPU is not affected or
+                  tsx_async_abort=off is supplied on the kernel command line.
+
+ tsx disabled     Mitigation is enabled. TSX feature is disabled by default at
+                  bootup on processors that support TSX control.
+
+ verw             Mitigation is enabled. CPU is affected and MD_CLEAR is
+                  advertised in CPUID.
+
+ ucode needed     Mitigation is enabled. CPU is affected and MD_CLEAR is not
+                  advertised in CPUID. That is mainly for virtualization
+                  scenarios where the host has the updated microcode but the
+                  hypervisor does not expose MD_CLEAR in CPUID. It's a best
+                  effort approach without guarantee.
+ =============    ============================================================
+
+If the CPU is affected and the "tsx_async_abort" kernel command line parameter is
+not provided then the kernel selects an appropriate mitigation depending on the
+status of RTM and MD_CLEAR CPUID bits.
+
+Below tables indicate the impact of tsx=on|off|auto cmdline options on state of
+TAA mitigation, VERW behavior and TSX feature for various combinations of
+MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES bits.

+
+In the tables, TSX_CTRL_MSR is a new bit in MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES that
+indicates whether MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL is supported.
+
+There are two control bits in IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR:
+
+      Bit 0: When set it disables the Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM)
+             sub-feature of TSX (will force all transactions to abort on the
+             XBEGIN instruction).
+
+      Bit 1: When set it disables the enumeration of the RTM and HLE feature
+             (i.e. it will make CPUID(EAX=7).EBX{bit4} and
+             CPUID(EAX=7).EBX{bit11} read as 0).

+	  Even with TSX enabled, the kernel will attempt to enable the best
+	  possible TAA mitigation setting depending on the microcode available
+	  for the particular machine.
+
+	  This option allows to set the default tsx mode between tsx=on, =off
+	  and =auto. See Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt for more
+	  details.

+		you have activated help mode, and you pressed
+		keypad 3.  Speakup
+		says: "keypad 3 is character, say next."
+		The message "character, say next" names a Speakup function, and
+		it comes from this function_names file.

+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/states
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	This file contains names for key states.
+		Again, these are part of the help system.  For instance, if you
+		had pressed speakup + keypad 3, you would hear:
+		"speakup keypad 3 is go to bottom edge."
+		The speakup key is depressed, so the name of the key state is
+		speakup.
+		This part of the message comes from the states collection.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/characters
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	Through this sys entry, Speakup gives you the ability to change
+		how Speakup pronounces a given character. You could, for
+		example, change how some punctuation characters are spoken. You
+		can even change how Speakup will pronounce certain letters. For
+		further details see '12.  Changing the Pronunciation of
+		Characters' in Speakup User's Guide (file spkguide.txt in
+		source).
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/colors
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	When you use the "say attributes" function, Speakup says the

+		from the i18n/colors file.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/formatted
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	This group of messages contains embedded formatting codes, to

+		these, you must preserve all of the formatting codes, and they
+		must appear in the order used by the default messages.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/i18n/key_names
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	Again, key_names is used by Speakup's help system.  In the
+		previous example, Speakup said that you pressed "keypad 3."
+		This name came from the key_names file.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/<synth-name>/
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	In `/sys/accessibility/speakup` is a directory corresponding to
+		the synthesizer driver currently in use (E.G) `soft` for the
+		soft driver. This directory contains files which control the
+		speech synthesizer itself,
+		as opposed to controlling the speakup
+		screen reader. The parameters in this directory have the same
+		names and functions across all
+		supported synthesizers. The range
+		of values for freq, pitch, rate, and vol is the same for all
+		supported synthesizers, with the given range being internally
+		mapped by the driver to  more or less fit the range of values
+		supported for a given parameter by the individual synthesizer.
+		Below is a description of values and  parameters for soft
+		synthesizer, which is currently the most commonly used.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/soft/caps_start
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	This is the string that is sent to the synthesizer to cause it
+		to start speaking uppercase letters. For the soft synthesizer
+		and most others, this causes the pitch of the voice to rise
+		above the currently set pitch.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/soft/caps_stop
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	This is the string sent to the synthesizer to cause it to stop
+		speaking uppercase letters. In the case of the soft synthesizer
+		and most others, this returns the pitch of the voice
+		down to the
+		currently set pitch.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/soft/delay_time
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	TODO:

+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/soft/direct
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	Controls if punctuation is spoken by speakup, or by the
+		synthesizer.
+		For example, speakup speaks ">" as "greater", while
+		the espeak synthesizer used by the soft driver speaks "greater
+		than". Zero lets speakup speak the punctuation. One lets the
+		synthesizer itself speak punctuation.
+
+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/soft/freq
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	Gets or sets the frequency of the speech synthesizer. Range is

+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	Gets or sets the tone of the speech synthesizer. The range for
+		the soft driver seems to be 0-2. This seems to make no

+What:		/sys/accessibility/speakup/soft/voice
+KernelVersion:	2.6
+Contact:	speakup@linux-speakup.org
+Description:	Gets or sets the voice used by the synthesizer if the
+		synthesizer can speak in more than one voice. The range for the

+ * @src:   Source address, in userspace.
+ * @usize: (Alleged) size of @src struct.

+ * old struct, and zeroed-out new fields have the same meaning as the old
+ * struct).

+ * @ksize is just sizeof(*dst), and @usize should've been passed by userspace.

+ *   }
+ *
+ * There are three cases to consider:
+ *  * If @usize == @ksize, then it's copied verbatim.
+ *  * If @usize < @ksize, then the userspace has passed an old struct to a
+ *    newer kernel. The rest of the trailing bytes in @dst (@ksize - @usize)
+ *    are to be zero-filled.
+ *  * If @usize > @ksize, then the userspace has passed a new struct to an
+ *    older kernel. The trailing bytes unknown to the kernel (@usize - @ksize)
+ *    are checked to ensure they are zeroed, otherwise -E2BIG is returned.
+ *
+ * Returns (in all cases, some data may have been copied):
